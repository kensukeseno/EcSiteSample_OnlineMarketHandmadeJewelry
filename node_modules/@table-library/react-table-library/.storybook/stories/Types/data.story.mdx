# Data

Either table component needs to receive the following `Data` type as `data` prop:

```javascript
export type TableNode = {
  id: string,
  nodes?: TableNode[] | Nullish,
  [prop: string]: any,
};

export type ExtendedTableNode = TableNode & {
  ancestors: TableNode[],
};

export type Data = {
  pageInfo?: any,
  nodes: TableNode[],
};
```

The `pageInfo` property is optional and can be used for **server-side** features such as pagination or infinite scrolling. The implementation details (e.g. [paginated tree table](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-tree-list/)) of it are up to you, but check out the server-side features (e.g. pagination) of this table library to get an example of it.

Access all feature related types:

```javascript
import * as TYPES from '@table-library/react-table-library/types/table';
```

Access **all** types:

```javascript
import * as TYPES from '@table-library/react-table-library/types';
```
