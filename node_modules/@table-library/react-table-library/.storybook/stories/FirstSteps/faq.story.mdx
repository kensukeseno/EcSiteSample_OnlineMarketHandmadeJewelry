# Which Table component(s) should I use?

Documentation-wise the `CompactTable` gives you an overview of all the features pretty early in the Compact Table section whereas the Composed Table goes in the Features section into all the nitty gritty details of all features.

Anyway, as said you will see both, `CompactTable`s and Composed Tables. Therefore you will need to know when to use which:

## Compact Table

The `CompactTable` is the straightforward yet basic usage of the table library: It's one table component to rule them all. All configuration of the table can be provided via props to this component. Under the hood, the `CompactTable` is an assembled composed table. Usually you will want to use `CompactTable` for most cases, however, once it gets more complex, you may want to use the Composed Table ...

## Composed Table

The composable table is not one component but a set of composable components (e.g. `Table`, `Row`, `Cell`) which use the philosophy of [composition over configuration](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-component-composition/). If you create complex tables, you want to access to all the components that make up a table. By using all the composable components, you get more fine-grained access to them.
