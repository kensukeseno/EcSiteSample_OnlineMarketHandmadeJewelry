# CSS Class

If you want to give a component a specific CSS class, do it this way:

```
<Row className="foo" ... >
```

Then if you want to style all Row components with this CSS class, specify it in the `THEME` that is passed to `const = useTheme(THEME);` (see Features/Theme):

```
const THEME = {
  Row: `
    &.foo {
      background-color: pink;
    }
  `
};
```

There are some built-in classes based on the built-in features. For example, the select state on a Row component: when you inspect the HTML element in the browser, you will see that the Row component receives the optional CSS classes based on its select status:

```
row-select-selected
row-select-single-selected
```

While the former is applied for multi-select, the latter gets applied for single select. So if you want to style a row for multi-select, do it the following way:

```
const THEME = {
  Row: `
    &.row-select-selected {
      background-color: red;
    }
  `
};
```

For single select, it would look like this:

```
const THEME = {
  Row: `
    &.row-select-single-selected {
      background-color: blue;
    }
  `
};
```

If you want to style both cases the same way, then use the selectors this way:

```
const THEME = {
  Row: `
    &.row-select-selected, &.row-select-single-selected {
      background-color: orange;
    }
  `
};
```
